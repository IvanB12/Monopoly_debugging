3) sad face in jail. checked, which class added to class player(player.addClass("jailed");),
 when player in jail,
 and made stylish for this class in css .player.jailed{
    background-image:url(../images/sadJailFace.png);
    background-size:contain;
    background-position:center;
}

4) Happy smile on own property :
  I added this line to fucntion Monopoly.handleTurn = function () {
else if (playerCell.is(".property:not(.available)") && playerCell.hasClass(player.attr("id"))) {
        Monopoly.handlePayRent(player, playerCell);
        player.addClass("happy");  
    } for all another cases in this function I removed this class using player.RemoveClass("happy"); 
 and added new class to css .player.happy{
    background-image:url(../images/happySmile.png);
    background-size:contain;
    background-position:center;
5) validation input:
Function that should validate input, "Monopoly.isValidInput" was written, incorrect. 
So I made new one, wher instead of broken switch case 
we have " if else statement", and only one parametr.

also in function Monopoly.initPopups I changed this line :if (Monopoly.isValidInput( numOfPlayers)), 
because it also took 2 parametres in fuction call.

6)  commetns : I will add comments after I will finish all ohter points
7) to much money: I will change after I will finish all ohter points  line 3 Monopoly.moneyAtStart = 1000;
8) Community card : implemented
I made almost same that for chance card:)

9) console.log: done

10) User Broke popup; done
didn't figure out how to kick out player

11) just changed multiplied value on negative number to get positive result. Fix Monopoly.handlePassedGo = function () {
    var player = Monopoly.getCurrentPlayer();
    Monopoly.updatePlayersMoney(player, -1*15);
};

12) Dice color: changed in CSS

13) double counter didn't handle
14) current ammount for each player
